      This morning I learned how to setup my local environment and push a product to GitHub. There was some trouble connecting to Atom from the terminal, but a quick google search provided the answer on Stack Overflow. Turns out that a symlink was not automatically created when Atom was installed. So I copied the code provided to create one.
